# Dev Assessment Project

## Overview
This project contains a series of Python programming tasks designed to test and improve skills in Git, code style, debugging, error handling, and API interaction.

## Completed Tasks
- **Task 1.2 – Git Basics**: Practiced branching, commits, and merging.  
- **Task 1.3 – Code Style**: Improved code readability and adhered to Python conventions (`bad_style.py`).  
- **Task 2.3 – Debugging and Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling in Python functions (`debug_errors.py`).  
- **Task 3.1 – API Interaction**: Fetched and displayed user data from a live API with error handling (`api_client.py`).  

## Instructions
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
# Most challenging
   Handling edge cases like empty lists, invalid indices, and unexpected API responses.

# Most interesting:
   Fetching and processing live API data and seeing real results in Python.

# One thing I learned/improved: 
   Enhanced skills in debugging, error handling, and managing multiple Git branches effectively.#
